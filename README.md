NetProbes
=========

This project intends to propose a way to test your network.

General layout is as follows :

1. install the application on the computers/servers you wish to test
2. use the commander to command one probe with add, do and remove commands
3. launch tests an get the results !

You can write your own tests in the tests package, as long as they implement the methods defineds in (probe.)tests.Test !

Synchronisation between the probes is done via http, so be sure that this is allowed between probes. **This is required for the project to work!!**

##Notice##

Developpment is in progress and results are currently unknown!!
